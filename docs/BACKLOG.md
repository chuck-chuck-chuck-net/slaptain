# Backlog (non-migration tech debt)

Cross-cutting cleanup items that aren't tied to the migration plan
(`docs/MIGRATION-PLAN.md`) or a single ADR. Keep entries small and actionable.

## Deprecation cleanup: `client.Apply` → `client.Client.Apply()` / `SubResource().Apply()`

**What:** controller-runtime deprecated the package-level `client.Apply` patch
type (staticcheck `SA1019`). All controllers currently use it for server-side
apply, e.g.:

```go
r.Patch(ctx, obj, client.Apply, client.ForceOwnership, client.FieldOwner(...))
r.Status().Patch(ctx, p, client.Apply, client.ForceOwnership, client.FieldOwner(...))
```

`make -C operator lint` flags this in `slapdcluster_controller.go` (×6),
`slapddatabase_controller.go`, `slapdschema_controller.go`, and
`slapdbackup_controller.go` — a handful of `SA1019` hits.

**Why deferred:** it's a uniform, mechanical migration to the newer
`client.Client.Apply()` / `client.Client.SubResource("status").Apply()` API
across every controller. Doing it wholesale in one focused change is cleaner
(and easier to review) than touching it inline inside unrelated feature work.
We are not ignoring it — it's parked here deliberately.

**How:** migrate every `client.Apply` call site in one pass; re-run
`make -C operator lint` to confirm the `SA1019` count drops to zero. Verify the
field-manager ownership semantics are unchanged (same `FieldOwner`,
`ForceOwnership`).

**Note:** `make -C operator lint` currently reports broader pre-existing debt
too (errcheck, gofmt, modernize, unused, gocyclo, lll — ~70 findings as of
2026-06-08). Worth a separate sweep, but out of scope for this entry.

## Add a README to the operator Helm chart (`charts/operator/`)

**What:** `charts/operator/` has no `README.md`. The project docs
(`README.md`, `docs/BACKUP.md`, ADRs) live in the repo, so a consumer who
installs the chart from a registry (`helm install … oci://…/slaptain-operator`)
has no docs at the point of use — values, CRDs, and the backup/restore feature
set are undiscoverable from the chart alone.

**Why deferred + open question:** unclear what shape it should take. Options:
a copy of the top-level `README.md` (drifts — two sources of truth); a thin
chart-specific README (values reference + "see the project README/docs for
concepts" links); or generated from `values.yaml` via a tool like
`helm-docs`. Decide the approach before writing it — a verbatim copy of the
top-level README is explicitly *not* wanted.

**How:** pick the approach (lean: a short chart README documenting `values.yaml`
knobs + image/CRD notes, linking back to the repo docs rather than duplicating
them), then keep it from drifting (helm-docs in `make operator-manifests`, or a
CI check).

## Remove the `foreignRIDs` field + its overlap validation (RIDs are consumer-local)

**What:** `SlapdDatabase.spec.replication.foreignRIDs` (and the validation that
rejects a DB whose computed RID range overlaps it) lets a deployer declare RIDs
"in use on the other side" of an external-peer relationship, to avoid a
cross-cluster RID collision. Remove it — the collision it guards against cannot
happen. A `rid` is the *consumer's* local handle for a syncrepl directive: it
keys that consumer's own replication cookie state and is never exchanged on the
wire. slaptain and any peer/source each number their own stanzas independently,
in disjoint per-node namespaces, so cross-cluster RID coordination is meaningless.

**Why deferred / why it's inconsistent right now:** ADR-011 was rewritten to drop
the cross-cluster RID discussion (RIDs are invisible across clusters), but that
rewrite deliberately did **not** touch the operator code. So the `foreignRIDs`
field + webhook currently outlive the ADR that justified them — no ADR endorses
the field anymore. This entry is the reconciliation reminder. (Contrast:
`foreignServerIDs` **stays** — ServerIDs *are* global, embedded in the CSN and
tracked in `contextCSN`, so cross-cluster ServerID collision is real.)

**How:** drop `foreignRIDs` from `SlapdDatabase` types + deepcopy + CRD; delete
the RID-overlap validation; keep `ridBase` (that's slaptain's *own* intra-cluster
RID uniqueness — still valid and still needed). Regenerate manifests; `grep -r
foreignRIDs` → 0. Update any docs/tests that referenced it.

## e2e framework: specs cannot provision their own topology

**What:** the Go e2e suite cannot stand up the environment it runs against. The
primary fixture — namespace, operator install, TLS, NodePort services, node
access IPs, cross-site kubeconfigs, versitygw — is provisioned by
`tests/e2e.sh` before `go test` starts, and `BeforeSuite` simply assumes it is
there. Specs *can* create `SlapdCluster` CRs (`restore_test.go`,
`restore_inplace_test.go`, `restore_replication_test.go` each do), but there is
no framework for "give me a cluster with topology X, reachable, with
credentials": every such spec hand-rolls the same boilerplate — clone images and
pull secrets from the source cluster, mirror the suffix, expose a NodePort,
read the generated password, wait for readiness — and depends on `E2E_NODE_IP`
being exported by the shell.

**Why it matters:** any behaviour that only appears in a *particular topology*
is effectively untestable without either bending the shared fixture or
duplicating that boilerplate again. It is why the whole suite leans on one
shared, mutable `slapd` cluster that ~15 specs read from and three actively
damage, and why cross-spec interference is a recurring failure mode (see the
`FAIL_FAST` / `E2E_SEED` knobs added for exactly this reason).

**Why deferred:** it is a refactor of the test framework, not a change to the
product, and doing it inline inside feature work would bury it. It wants a
deliberate design pass: what a "cluster fixture" helper looks like, whether
`e2e.sh` shrinks to bootstrapping only the operator and the S3 target, and how
per-topology fixtures are torn down without leaking PVCs.

**How:** introduce a fixture helper that provisions a `SlapdCluster` +
`SlapdDatabase` of a requested shape (replica count, replication on/off,
external peers or none, TLS or not), exposes it, returns a connected client, and
registers its own cleanup. Port the three existing hand-rolled cases onto it
first — they are the specification for what the helper must do.

## Permanent e2e coverage for in-place restore topologies

**What:** `SlapdRestore` has three topologies with different meanings (ADR-014,
amendment 2026-08-24), and automated coverage exists for only one:

| Topology | Meaning | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `replicas: 1`, replication off | true rollback | `restore_inplace_test.go` — green 2026-08-24 |
| N≥2, no external peers | true rollback; the accesslog wipe matters here | **verified manually only** |
| mesh member (external peers) | local re-seed, mesh repairs | none — and none is wanted as a *rollback* assertion |

`restore_replay_test.go` is the spec for row 2 — it guards the accesslog-wipe fix
(`fix(restore): wipe the accesslog LMDB on restore under replication`). It
currently runs against the **shared** primary cluster, so on a multi-site
deployment it asserts rollback semantics in the one topology where they are not
promised, and fails deterministically. It needs its own N≥2 cluster with no
external peers.

**Why deferred:** blocked on the e2e framework item above — relocating it means
hand-rolling a fourth bespoke cluster, which is the duplication that item exists
to remove. Until then the spec's red on multi-site runs is *expected* and should
not be read as a product regression.

**How:** once the fixture helper exists, move the spec onto a dedicated N≥2,
no-external-peers cluster. That restores its validity, closes the row-2 gap, and
removes the most destructive spec from the shared fixture as a side effect.

## Cross-site orchestration (hub-and-spoke) — explicitly undecided

**What:** automating the mesh-wide rollback runbook (`docs/BACKUP.md`, "Rolling
back a replicated deployment") so it becomes one declarative action instead of a
careful manual sequence across N clusters.

**Why this is not just a feature:** it requires one actor to drive *other*
clusters — quiesce them, run restores there, and sequence the result. Today the
operator reaches across clusters only to **read**: it discovers peer pod
addresses through a remote kubeconfig (ADR-007 amendment, ADR-016). Driving a
remote site is categorically different. It introduces a control plane, and with
it hub failure, partition behaviour, and arbitration — and it stands in direct
tension with this project's second architectural requirement, that each site be
autonomous.

**Why deferred, and deliberately undecided:** this is a fundamentals question,
not a backlog chore. It is recorded here so the option is not lost, *not* as an
agreed direction. The current answer — a human-operated distributed runbook — is
legitimate and is how comparable systems document the same operation. Nothing
about it is broken; it is manual.

**If pursued:** it gets its own ADR, deciding the topology (a control-plane
cluster? a peer-elected coordinator? a CLI-driven sequence with no new
controller?) and the failure semantics before any code. See the ADR-014
amendment (2026-08-24), section "Not decided: hub-and-spoke orchestration".
