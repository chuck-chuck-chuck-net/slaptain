# Reconcile Loop Fixes

Log of bugs found and fixed in the operator's reconciliation loop.
Kept to prevent running in circles when debugging similar issues in the future.

## 2026-04-16: go-ldap attribute name case sensitivity

**Symptom:** `syncreplChanged: true` and `mirrorModeChanged: true` on every reconcile cycle, causing the operator to rewrite identical syncrepl stanzas every 10 seconds.

**Root cause:** go-ldap v3.4.12's `GetAttributeValues()` uses **exact string comparison** (`attr.Name == attribute`), not case-insensitive matching. OpenLDAP returns attributes under their canonical schema names:

| We requested | OpenLDAP returned | Match? |
|---|---|---|
| `olcSyncRepl` | `olcSyncrepl` | no (capital R vs lowercase r) |
| `olcMirrorMode` | `olcMultiProvider` | no (completely different name, OL 2.5+ rename) |

Both reads returned empty, so the operator always saw a diff and replaced.

**Fix:** Switched all `GetAttributeValues()` calls to `GetEqualFoldAttributeValues()` (case-insensitive). Changed `olcMirrorMode` reads/writes to `olcMultiProvider` (the canonical name in OpenLDAP 2.5+).

**Why it was invisible:** The init container (`bootstrap.sh`) sets up working syncrepl independently of the operator. The operator's constant rewrite was functionally a no-op (same values). The e2e replication tests verify data propagation (write pod-0, read pod-1), not cn=config idempotency.

**Lesson:** When reading cn=config attributes via go-ldap, always use `GetEqualFoldAttributeValues()`. LDAP attribute names are case-insensitive per RFC 4512, but go-ldap's default getter is not.

## 2026-04-16: Operator stops reconciling before all pods are configured

**Symptom:** Pod-2 (and sometimes pod-1) never gets ACLs, schemas, or syncrepl configured. The replication user `cn=replication` doesn't exist on unconfigured pods, causing `rc 49` (invalid credentials) errors from pods trying to sync from them.

**Root cause:** `reconcileACLs()`, `reconcileSchemas()`, and `reconcileReplication()` silently swallowed per-pod errors (logged and skipped unreachable pods, returned `nil`). The main `Reconcile()` function then checked StatefulSet readiness (3/3 pods Running), reached `PhaseRunning`, and returned `ctrl.Result{}` — no more requeues. Pods that were unreachable during early startup (DNS not yet propagated for the headless service) were never retried.

**Fix:** Changed the three functions to return `(skipped bool, err error)`. The main loop now requeues after 10s if any pod was skipped, regardless of phase.

**Why it was hard to spot:** The operator logs said "will retry on next reconcile" but there was no next reconcile — `PhaseRunning` suppressed the requeue. The slapd pods appeared healthy (Running, Ready) because the init container handled the base setup; only the operator-managed layers (ACLs, schemas, syncrepl stanzas) were missing.

**Lesson:** Any reconcile step that skips work due to transient errors must propagate that fact to the requeue decision. "Log and skip" without forcing a retry is a silent failure mode.
